<h3>Ingrediants Required:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>2 Cups Soy Sauce (<i>or use low sodium soy sauce for a healthier option</i>)</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Water</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>1 Pound of Beef Tips (<i>or use sirloin for a leaner cut</i>)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol class="list2">
        <li>Gather your Soy Sauce, Water, Sugar, Black Pepper, and Sesame Seeds <br> and mix them into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once mixed chop your beef into small slices of desired length.</li>
        <li>After beef has been cut to a satisfactory length marinate the beef<br> in the mixture from step one. The beef should be left to marinate<br> for at least <strong>24-hours</strong>. Longer marination adds more flavor.</li>
        <li>After marinating the beef cook the beef slices in a saucepan on <br> medium to high heat for approximately two minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Let beef cool and enjoy your very own homemade beef bulgogi!</li>

<h3>What Makes This Recipe Special to Me?</h3>
<p>Growing up I spent a large amount of my childhood with my Korean Grandparents. <br>
    Tasting this bulgogi brings me back to those times and all the amazing memories I've <br>
    had with my grandparents. Since then I have had many different iterations of this dish, <br>
    but none make me feel the way this recipe does. I sincerely hope this recipe can bring <br>
    the same joy to you as it has for me.
