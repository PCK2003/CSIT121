<h2>The Select and Option Element:</h2>
<p>The select element, or select list, is a form element which allows users to select 
    a single value from a list of values. These are commonly refered to as drop-down 
    boxes or drop-down lists. This element is useful in providing pre-designated 
    choices to users regarding some sort of query such as their insurance provider. These pre-designated choices are created 
    using the option element which contain the potential choices. Neither of these elements 
    are void tags. The size attribute can be used to decide how many options will be displayed on
    screen without clicking the form. An example has been provided below.
